=============================
A Simple Local Area Network Messenger Written in Java
------------------------------
About Software
==============================
SimpleLocalNetworkMessenger is a messenger application within the local
network. This project was designated as the Advanced Programming Course
at the University of Guilan in 2013. You can use this software free of
charge, but notice that the data transferred by the software is not
securely transmitted and the passwords are kept on the server in plain
text. My goal of publishing this project here is to provide a simple 
and practical example of socket programming in java.
